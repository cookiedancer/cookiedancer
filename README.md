## I'm a Teacher, Researcher and Curriculum Developer.

#### I began my working life as a classically trained dancer.  As a result, I place a strong emphasis on 'learning by doing', as this experience is essential in reinforcing theories and concepts.  I have taught and developed curricula used on-ground and online in colleges and universities. My background includes programming languages such as Java, JavaScript, C++, C#, and Python, mobile computing, game design & development, and cybersecurity.  I enjoy  mentoring and tutoring students, and preparing students for certifications and onboarding.
