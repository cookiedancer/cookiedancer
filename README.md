### Hello, I'm Thelma. ðŸ‘‹

<!--![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=cookiedancer&color=0ca4a5) -->

## I'm a Teacher, Researcher and Curriculum Developer.

#### I began my working life as a classically trained dancer.  As a result, I place a strong emphasis on learning by doing, as this experience is essential in reinforcing theories and concepts.  I have taught and developed curricula used on-ground and online in colleges and universities. My background includes teaching programming languages such as Java, C++, and Python, mobile computing, game design & development, and cybersecurity.  I enjoy  mentoring and tutoring students, and working to prepare students for certifications and onboarding.
